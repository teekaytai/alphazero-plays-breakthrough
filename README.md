## AlphaZero Plays Breakthrough

This repo contains the code for training an agent to play Breakthrough using AlphaZero.

Run `main.py` to train the agent. The program can be terminated at any time, and the next time it is run the training process will resume from the latest checkpoint saved.

`eval.py` contains code for evaluating the performance of agents against one another. Of the models we trained given our limited time/resources, model 2 was the strongest.

Run `play.py` to try playing against the trained AlphaZero agent yourself in a terminal!
